## EventsEye
An events website that allows users to search for upcoming shows, attractions and more. 

## UX
Enjoyment, amusement and entertainment play a significant role in our lives such as improving our relationships, reducing stress and make us more enegetic and youthful (Rucker, 2016). For this reasons I decided to develop 
EventsEye which provides a solution for searching for events in different categories including sports, music, arts & theatre, film and miscellaneous. EventsEye is built based on the Discovery API which provides access to content sourced 
from different platforms such as Ticketmaster, Universe, FrontGate and Ticketmaster Resale. There are over 230K+ events available in the API for various geographical regions inlcuding the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe, Australia and New Zealand.  

On the home page there is a youthful background with cheerful people taking part in a music event. Additionally, there are three select bars to select the country, city and event genre together with an inspirational quote from Randy Pausch at the bottom of the page.
Once the user selects the country, the city bar is populated and so the genre bar. 
Furthermore, when the user selects the country of interest, the events that will take place in such area will be displayed below the background image. Thus, the user have a deeper appreciation for the changes in the events when filtering for each select bar.  

The searched events are displayed with features including but not limted to the following: Event name, type of event, start and end time, sale status, ticket limit information, seatmap, venue address, venue image, parking details, link to purchase tickets, etc.  
Each piece of information including the images are retrieved from the API as strings of text and are put together and presentend on the page in a readable, easy-to-use and slick manner. 
On big screens the image of the artist is displayed at the center and the seatmap together with the venue image are displayed on the left side. For small screens all images are centered to provide a slicker layout.
